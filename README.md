# Neovim Configuration

My config has some of the following:

  1. Tree-sitter

  2. CoC ( I plan on switching to lsp's when I find the time to configure them )

  3. Nvim-Tree

  4. Nvim-Surround
  
  5. My own code runner plugin
  
  6. My own terminal plugin

Feel free to take this and make it your own or give me suggestions

**NOT EVERYTHING** is documented, so be weary

**I have** commented the code runner file though
